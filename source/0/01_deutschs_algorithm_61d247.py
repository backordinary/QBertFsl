    Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm

    Consider a function f(x) that takes as input n-bit strings x and returns 0 or 1. Suppose we are
    promised that f(x) is either a constant function that takes the same value c in {0,1} on all
    inputs x, or a balanced function that takes each value 0 and 1 on exactly half of the inputs. 
    The goal is to decide whether f is constant or balanced by making as few function evaluations 
    as possible. Classically, it requires 2^{n-1}+1 function evaluations in the worst case. Using 
    the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the question can be answered with just one function evaluation.
    
    Deutsch's algorithm is the simpler case of Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm which has a function f(x) 
    which takes 1-bit as input.

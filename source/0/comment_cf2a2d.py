"""Implementation of a comment instruction.

The comment instruction is a hack to be able to insert comments in the
generated OpenQASM code. Comments are then ignored and removed by the
Qiskit compiler so they will only appear in the generated OpenQASM.

The Comment gate overloads the Barrier gate, which *does not* change the
circuit result but *might change* the final OpenQASM code by preventing
some optimisations.

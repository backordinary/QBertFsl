"""Script used to find the best parameters for the Hamiltonian simulation.

The paper of Cao et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2232v2) introduce an
Hamiltonian decomposition for their specific matrix. In this paper, they
also say that the circuit simulating the powers of the simulated
Hamiltonian can be obtained by multiplying the numeric parameters of 5
gates by a constant. After trying, it seems that this technique does not
work.
The method used here is not based on a mathematical analysis and its
convergence has not been studied. In other words, the fact that the
different powers of the Hamiltonian could be expressed just by changing
the coefficients of the circuit given in the paper of Cao et al. has
only been verified experimentally.

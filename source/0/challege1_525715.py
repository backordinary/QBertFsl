# At first, we find the final matrix coefficients. for state 0.6 probability of state 0, and 0.4 of 1, let us assume the coefficient by x and y that is the qubit in state q = x|0> + y|1>, therefore, we know that 0.6 = x^2/(x^2+y^2), =>x = √(3/2), y = 1. Now we know the final qubit matrix coefficients,
# We just need to find the angle for ry gate for which we can convert the matrix to this state!
# that is by  using ```Ry(θ) it will transform the qubit from the |0⟩ state to |ψ⟩=cosθ2|0⟩+sinθ2|1⟩,```, Using cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ) = 1 and finding theta for this case
# We get θ=1.369
